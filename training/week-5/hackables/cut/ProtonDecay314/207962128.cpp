Wait, what if I...


X/X X|X X|X X

Looks like the halving
approach is not the best

BUT, I can think of a brute force now HAHA

Time complexity is N choose L, which is probably
not going to pass now that I think about it .-.

Unless... what if we binary search the answer?

X/X X X X X X

Could you tell whether the above is possible?
Yes! Just go through left to right and keep cutting ^^
Time complexity: O(L), which passes 1-4 likely

Can't we do better though?

Yes!

Let's say that we're checking if the answer is 4
Simple case:
15, how many cuts? (3)
12, how many cuts? (2)
[9, 12] -> 2

(l - 1) // ans cuts required
